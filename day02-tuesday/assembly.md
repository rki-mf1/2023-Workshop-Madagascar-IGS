# 2023 Workshop MISSIoN Nanopore Bioinformatics - Day 02

Now, we will look into _de novo_ assembly (genome reconstruction) using long-read nanopore sequencing data.

Once you have a genome assembly in FASTA format, you can continue with annotation.

**Because there is not really a difference in the tools and steps to perform annotation on an Illumina- or Nanopore-based assembly, we will skip this part here and leave that to the excercise.**
