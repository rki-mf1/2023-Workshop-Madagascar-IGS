## General information & Setup

* This GitHub repository will guide you through the whole workshop
    * That means, that we will also jump a bit around between this repository, slide decks, the terminal, demo examples, and hands-on sessions
* You will find example commands in this workshop repository
    * **keep in mind** that these are examples! You should always familiarize yourself with a bioinformatics tool (read the publication, the GitHub README, ...)
    * we will mostly use default parameter settings if not otherwise stated, which might be not optimal for your own data!
    * remember that `--help` and google (and ChatGPT) are your friends! 
* Please raise your hand to ask a question at any time
* There will be always "lecture" parts followed by practical hands-on 
* We continue to work with the laptops you already used in the Illumina part
* In the future, you might also use the HPC (High-performance Cluster) at RKI, which we can also give a try during the course
    * Details about HPC usage can be found in the intranet (Confluence)
